# LightfeatherDemo

# Hello!
# In order to set up the application, clone the repo to a folder
# The api solution will run upon cloning once opened in Visual Studio
# Run npm install on the UI and ng s and it'll run. I've cloned it twice in this way and it works
# Let me know if you have issues, my email is jlc3939@gmail.com
